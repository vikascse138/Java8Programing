This image shows a snippet of a logback.xml configuration file with structured logging in JSON format, typically used in Java applications to log events in a structured and parsable way. Here’s a detailed explanation of the key lines in the file:

1. <springProfile name="local">

This block defines a logging configuration specific to the local Spring profile. When this profile is active, the configuration within this block is applied. This is useful to differentiate logging behavior across environments (e.g., local, dev, prod).

2. <appender name="consoleAppender" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
	•	This defines a ConsoleAppender named consoleAppender.
	•	ConsoleAppender outputs logs directly to the console (stdout), which is useful for local development or debugging.

3. <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LoggingEventCompositeJsonEncoder">
	•	This specifies an encoder to format logs in JSON.
	•	The LoggingEventCompositeJsonEncoder from the logstash-logback-encoder library is used to encode the log events into a structured JSON format.

4. <providers>
	•	This block specifies additional components to enhance the structured logging output.
	•	Each <provider> or section under it adds information to the JSON logs.

4.1 <timestamp />
	•	Automatically adds a timestamp field to the JSON log entry.
	•	The timestamp indicates when the log event occurred.

4.2 <pattern>
	•	Specifies custom fields to include in the JSON logs using a predefined pattern.

Example Fields in the Pattern:

{
    "application": "tpp-payment-platform-ingestion-service",
    "project": "trading-partner-payment",
    "environment": "${DEPLOY_ENV}",
    "region": "${DEPLOY_REGION}",
    "traceId": "${mdc[traceId]}"
}

Details:
	•	application: The name of the application (hardcoded as tpp-payment-platform-ingestion-service).
	•	project: The broader project this application is part of (hardcoded as trading-partner-payment).
	•	environment: Dynamically injected from an environment variable ${DEPLOY_ENV}.
	•	region: Dynamically injected from an environment variable ${DEPLOY_REGION}.
	•	traceId: Extracted from the MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context), which is a key-value pair system for storing contextual information (like traceId) per thread. This ensures logs related to a single request or transaction are tied together.

5. <logLevel />
	•	This section specifies that the level (e.g., INFO, ERROR, DEBUG) of the log will be included in the JSON logs.

6. <stackTrace>
	•	This block configures how stack traces are logged when exceptions occur.

6.1 <fieldName>stackTrace</fieldName>
	•	Specifies the name of the field in the JSON where the stack trace will be included.

6.2 <throwableConverter class="net.logstash.logback.stacktrace.ShortenedThrowableConverter">
	•	Customizes how exceptions and stack traces are logged.
	•	The ShortenedThrowableConverter trims the stack trace for readability and size optimization.

Details:
	•	<exclude>: Excludes specific classes/packages from the stack trace (e.g., net.sf.cglib.* is excluded).
	•	<maxDepthPerThrowable>30</maxDepthPerThrowable>: Limits the stack trace depth to 30 lines for each exception to avoid overly verbose logs.
	•	<rootCauseFirst>true</rootCauseFirst>: Ensures the root cause of the exception is displayed first, which is helpful for debugging.

7. <appender name="queueConsole" class="ch.qos.logback.classic.AsyncAppender">
	•	Defines an AsyncAppender named queueConsole.
	•	AsyncAppender buffers log messages and writes them asynchronously, improving application performance under high log traffic.

7.1 <discardingThreshold>0</discardingThreshold>
	•	Ensures no logs are discarded, even if the buffer is full.

7.2 <queueSize>10000</queueSize>
	•	Sets the buffer size to hold up to 10,000 log messages. If the buffer is full, lower-priority logs may be discarded (if allowed).

7.3 <appender-ref ref="consoleAppender" />
	•	Refers to the consoleAppender, meaning logs formatted by the consoleAppender will be processed asynchronously.

Purpose of this Configuration
	•	Structured JSON Logs: Generates logs in JSON format, making them easily searchable and parsable in tools like Splunk, ELK, or Fluentd.
	•	Environment-Specific Logging: Differentiates between local and production environments using Spring profiles.
	•	Traceability: Includes a traceId field to correlate logs across microservices.
	•	Optimized Stack Traces: Limits verbosity of exceptions while retaining useful debugging information.
	•	Performance: Uses asynchronous logging to minimize the impact of logging on application performance.

Enhancements You Can Consider
	1.	Log Rotation: Configure a rolling policy to rotate logs daily and delete logs older than a certain duration (e.g., 30 days) if required in production.
	2.	Additional Metadata: Add more fields to the JSON logs, such as spanId, userId, or sessionId, for better debugging and monitoring.
	3.	Dynamic Log Level Management: Use Spring Actuator to dynamically change log levels without restarting the application.

Let me know if you’d like further help refining or enhancing this configuration!













To ensure that logs are deleted after 1 year in a Kubernetes environment, you need to configure log rotation and retention policies. Since you don’t directly control the deployment files and Kubernetes configurations, here are the best approaches:

1. Log Rotation and Retention with Logback

Logback itself does not directly manage Kubernetes log files (usually /var/log/containers/). However, if you are writing logs to a file (e.g., using a RollingFileAppender), you can configure it to delete logs older than 1 year.

Logback Configuration for 1-Year Retention

Modify your logback.xml file with the following:

<appender name="ROLLING_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
    <file>${LOG_DIR}/application.log</file>
    <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
        <!-- Rotate logs daily -->
        <fileNamePattern>${LOG_DIR}/application.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log</fileNamePattern>
        <!-- Retain logs for 365 days (1 year) -->
        <maxHistory>365</maxHistory>
    </rollingPolicy>
    <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LoggingEventCompositeJsonEncoder">
        <providers>
            <timestamp />
            <pattern>
                {
                    "application": "${APP_NAME}",
                    "environment": "${ENV}",
                    "level": "%level",
                    "logger": "%logger",
                    "thread": "%thread",
                    "message": "%message",
                    "traceId": "%X{traceId}",
                    "spanId": "%X{spanId}"
                }
            </pattern>
        </providers>
    </encoder>
</appender>

Explanation:
	•	<fileNamePattern>: Specifies the file naming convention, rotating daily.
	•	<maxHistory>: Ensures logs older than 365 days are automatically deleted.

2. Use Kubernetes Log Rotation Policy

Logs written to stdout and stderr (from the ConsoleAppender) are managed by Kubernetes, not by your application. To retain logs for 1 year, the Kubernetes team or administrator must configure log rotation for the nodes.

Steps for Kubernetes Log Retention

Kubernetes uses containerd or docker to manage container logs, and these logs are typically stored in /var/log/containers/. By default, Kubernetes rotates logs based on size, not time. You can request your OpenShift/Kubernetes team to configure the log retention policy as follows:

Example Log Retention Policy in /etc/logrotate.conf:

/var/log/containers/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 365
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    copytruncate
}

Key Directives:
	•	daily: Rotate logs daily.
	•	rotate 365: Keep logs for 365 rotations (1 year).
	•	compress: Compress older log files to save space.
	•	missingok: Skip rotation if no logs are found.
	•	copytruncate: Truncate the original log file after creating a copy for rotation.

Command for Validation:

Ask your Kubernetes/OpenShift administrator to validate the retention policy:

logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf

3. Configure Fluentd or Log Aggregation Tool

If you are using a centralized logging system like Fluentd, Elasticsearch (via EFK/ELK stack), or Splunk, you can configure log retention policies there.

Example Fluentd Configuration for Retention

In Fluentd, you can set up a retention policy at the indexing or storage layer (e.g., Elasticsearch):

<match kubernetes.**>
  @type elasticsearch
  host elasticsearch-logging
  port 9200
  logstash_format true
  logstash_prefix kubernetes
  flush_interval 5s
  # Retention policy: Logs older than 1 year will be deleted
  buffer_chunk_limit 1m
  buffer_queue_limit 32
  time_key @timestamp
  time_key_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z
  include_tag_key true
  index_name kubernetes-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}
</match>

	•	Use Elasticsearch Index Lifecycle Policies (ILM) to delete logs older than 1 year:

{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {}
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "365d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

4. Using OpenShift Logging

If you’re using OpenShift Logging (e.g., based on Elasticsearch, Fluentd, or Loki), ask the OpenShift team to configure the retention settings.

For Elasticsearch in OpenShift:
	•	Set up Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) as shown above.
	•	Use the oc CLI to apply policies.

oc set env ds/logging-fluentd LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=365

5. Verify Log Retention in Kubernetes

To ensure logs are deleted after 1 year:
	1.	Check the log rotation settings:

cat /etc/docker/daemon.json

Example:

{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "365"
  }
}


	2.	Restart the container runtime (containerd or docker) for changes to take effect.

Summary:
	•	Logback (maxHistory=365): Ensures application-level logs older than 1 year are deleted.
	•	Kubernetes Log Rotation: Ensure log rotation on Kubernetes nodes is configured for 1-year retention.
	•	Centralized Logging Systems: Use Elasticsearch or Fluentd retention policies for aggregated logs.

Ask your Kubernetes/OpenShift administrator to implement the node-level log retention policy if required. Let me know if you’d like further details or assistance!








When writing logs in Kubernetes (typically to stdout and stderr), the log retention duration depends on how the Kubernetes environment is configured. Kubernetes itself does not automatically manage log retention, but here’s what influences how long your logs will exist:

1. Default Kubernetes Behavior

Logs written to stdout and stderr are stored as files on the node hosting the pod, under /var/log/containers/. These logs exist until one of the following happens:
	•	The pod is deleted.
	•	The node itself is drained, deleted, or restarted.
	•	Log rotation or retention policies delete them.

Kubernetes does not automatically delete logs, but the retention depends on how the logging system (e.g., Docker, containerd, or CRI-O) is configured.

2. Container Runtime-Specific Log Retention

Kubernetes delegates logging to the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd, or CRI-O). Here’s how each runtime handles logs:

a. Docker
	•	By default, Docker uses the json-file log driver, which writes logs to /var/log/containers/ as JSON files.
	•	Logs are rotated based on size, not time, unless explicitly configured.
	•	Example default retention:
	•	Max File Size: 10MB (per log file).
	•	Max Number of Files: Unlimited unless configured.

To configure log retention in Docker:

{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "5"
  }
}

This configuration will keep 5 log files of 10MB each, retaining ~50MB of logs per container.

b. containerd
	•	Logs are stored in /var/log/pods/ and /var/log/containers/ but are not rotated by default.
	•	You can configure log rotation using external tools like logrotate or Fluentd.

c. CRI-O
	•	Similar to containerd, logs are stored in /var/log/pods/ or /var/log/containers/.
	•	Rotation can be configured in the CRI-O configuration file:

/etc/crio/crio.conf

Example:

[crio.runtime]
log_size_max = 50000000  # 50MB
log_file_max = 10        # Maximum number of log files

3. Kubernetes Node Log Rotation

On most Kubernetes clusters, node-level log rotation is handled using logrotate (or a similar mechanism). This ensures logs in /var/log/containers/ don’t consume unlimited space.

Default logrotate settings:
	•	Log rotation is size-based.
	•	Logs are typically rotated when they reach 10MB or 100MB (depends on configuration).
	•	Older logs are retained for a limited number of rotations (e.g., 5-10 files).

To retain logs for a specific time (e.g., 1 year), the Kubernetes administrator can modify the logrotate configuration:

/var/log/containers/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 365
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    copytruncate
}

This retains logs for 365 days, rotating daily.

4. Centralized Log Aggregation

If your logs are being collected by a centralized logging system (e.g., EFK Stack, Loki, or Splunk), the retention policy depends on the aggregator, not Kubernetes.

Common retention policies:
	•	Elasticsearch (EFK): Logs are retained for a configurable duration (e.g., 30, 90, or 365 days) using Index Lifecycle Policies (ILM).
	•	Loki: Retains logs based on the configuration file (e.g., max time).
	•	Splunk: Logs are retained based on indexing rules.

Example Elasticsearch Retention:

You can configure Elasticsearch to delete logs older than 1 year using ILM:

{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {}
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "365d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

5. Pod Log Deletion

If the pod is deleted, its logs are also deleted from the node. This means:
	•	Logs stored in /var/log/containers/ are tied to the lifecycle of the pod.
	•	If a pod is restarted (e.g., due to a crash or update), old logs are lost unless they are aggregated in a centralized logging system.

Summary of Log Lifetime in Kubernetes
	1.	By Default:
	•	Logs persist on the node as long as the pod exists and log rotation is not triggered.
	•	Logs are not deleted automatically unless the pod is deleted or the node is drained/restarted.
	2.	Retention with Centralized Logging:
	•	Logs can be retained indefinitely or based on a configured policy in tools like Fluentd, Elasticsearch, or Splunk.
	3.	Retention with Log Rotation:
	•	Node-level log rotation (via logrotate) may delete old logs after a certain size or number of files.
	4.	Recommended Approach:
	•	If you need logs to persist for 1 year, request your Kubernetes administrator to:
	•	Configure centralized logging (e.g., Elasticsearch, Fluentd, or Splunk) with a 1-year retention policy.
	•	Set up node-level logrotate to retain logs for up to 1 year.

Let me know if you’d like further details on configuring log rotation or retention!











Let me explain how your system will behave based on the logback.xml file in the uploaded image and its setup. I’ll also detail how logs will be generated, sent to Splunk, and how traceId remains consistent across microservices. Finally, I’ll provide relevant implementation details.

1. Behavior of Your Logging System

1.1. Log Generation in Kubernetes
	•	ConsoleAppender:
	•	Logs are written to stdout using the consoleAppender.
	•	These logs are in JSON format as per the configuration in your logback.xml. For example:

{
    "application": "tpp-payment-platform-ingestion-service",
    "project": "trading-partner-payment",
    "environment": "production",
    "region": "us-west",
    "traceId": "abcd1234",
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "This is a sample log message",
    "timestamp": "2024-12-12T10:00:00.000Z"
}


	•	AsyncAppender:
	•	Your configuration includes queueConsole, an AsyncAppender.
	•	This buffers logs asynchronously in memory (up to 10,000 messages) before passing them to the consoleAppender. This ensures that logging does not block the application under high load.
	•	Kubernetes Logging Behavior:
	•	The stdout logs from your app are automatically captured by Kubernetes and written to the node filesystem in /var/log/containers/.
	•	For example:

/var/log/containers/my-pod_my-namespace_my-container.log

1.2. How Splunk Reads Logs from Kubernetes
	1.	Log Forwarding:
	•	Kubernetes logs in /var/log/containers/ are typically collected by a log forwarding agent like Fluentd, Fluent Bit, or Splunk Universal Forwarder.
	•	For example, Fluentd tails the logs from the /var/log/containers/ directory and forwards them to Splunk in real-time.
	2.	Parsing Logs in Splunk:
	•	Splunk uses predefined parsing rules to ingest the JSON logs generated by your logback.xml.
	•	Key fields (e.g., traceId, application, environment, message, and timestamp) are extracted into searchable fields in Splunk’s index.
	3.	Displaying Logs in the Splunk Dashboard:
	•	Logs are searchable and displayed in Splunk dashboards with filters like traceId="abcd1234" to view all logs for a specific request.

1.3. How TraceId Is Consistent Across Microservices
	1.	TraceId Generation:
	•	When a request enters the first microservice, a traceId is generated (if not already present) using the logic in the TraceIdFilter (explained below).
	•	This traceId is added to the MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) for all subsequent log messages.
	2.	TraceId Propagation:
	•	The traceId is added to outgoing HTTP headers (e.g., X-Trace-Id) by the first microservice.
	•	Downstream microservices extract this traceId from the incoming HTTP request headers and add it to their MDC for logging.
	3.	Consistent Logging Across Services:
	•	Since all microservices log with the same traceId, logs across the services for the same request are correlated and searchable in Splunk.

2. Implementation Details

2.1. Minimal Changes to Your Existing logback.xml

Your logback.xml is already well-configured for structured JSON logging. Here’s a small enhancement to ensure better traceability:
	•	Add spanId for finer-grained tracing:

"traceId": "smdc[traceId]",
"spanId": "smdc[spanId]"

2.2. TraceId Propagation Across Microservices

To ensure consistent traceId across microservices, you need two things:
	1.	A filter to generate and extract traceId.
	2.	HTTP client instrumentation to pass traceId in outgoing requests.

TraceIdFilter

Add the following filter to your microservice:

import org.slf4j.MDC;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.UUID;

@Component
public class TraceIdFilter implements Filter {

    private static final String TRACE_ID_HEADER = "X-Trace-Id";

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, javax.servlet.ServletException {

        HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;

        try {
            // Extract or generate traceId
            String traceId = httpRequest.getHeader(TRACE_ID_HEADER);
            if (traceId == null || traceId.isEmpty()) {
                traceId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
            }

            // Add traceId and spanId to MDC
            MDC.put("traceId", traceId);
            MDC.put("spanId", UUID.randomUUID().toString()); // Unique for each microservice

            chain.doFilter(request, response);
        } finally {
            // Clear MDC after request
            MDC.clear();
        }
    }
}

HTTP Client Configuration

Ensure outgoing HTTP requests propagate the traceId. For example, with RestTemplate:

import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.HttpRequest;
import org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpRequestExecution;
import org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpRequestInterceptor;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TraceIdInterceptor implements ClientHttpRequestInterceptor {

    private static final String TRACE_ID_HEADER = "X-Trace-Id";

    @Override
    public HttpRequest intercept(HttpRequest request, byte[] body, ClientHttpRequestExecution execution) throws IOException {
        String traceId = MDC.get("traceId");
        if (traceId != null) {
            request.getHeaders().add(TRACE_ID_HEADER, traceId);
        }
        return execution.execute(request, body);
    }
}

2.3. Splunk Dashboard Configuration
	1.	Indexing Configuration:
	•	Ensure Splunk is indexing the logs from Fluentd or the forwarder.
	•	Create a JSON parser for fields like traceId, level, message, application, etc.
	2.	Search Query:
	•	Use traceId to correlate logs:

index=<your-index> traceId="abcd1234"


	3.	Visualization:
	•	Use Splunk’s dashboards to group logs by traceId or application name.

3. End-to-End Example Flow
	1.	A request enters Microservice A.
	2.	TraceIdFilter checks for X-Trace-Id in the headers:
	•	If absent, it generates a new traceId and sets it in the MDC.
	•	If present, it uses the provided traceId.
	3.	Logs in Microservice A include the traceId.
	4.	Microservice A makes a call to Microservice B, adding X-Trace-Id in the HTTP headers.
	5.	Microservice B extracts the traceId and includes it in its logs.
	6.	Fluentd collects logs from Kubernetes /var/log/containers/ and forwards them to Splunk.
	7.	Splunk indexes the logs, making them searchable by traceId.
	8.	A Splunk dashboard visualizes the end-to-end flow of logs for the traceId.

Final Thoughts
	•	Your current logback.xml is already optimized for structured logging with Splunk.
	•	Minimal changes like adding spanId and ensuring traceId propagation via filters and HTTP clients will make it fully compliant for distributed tracing.
	•	Let me know if you need further assistance with configurations or Splunk queries!









 The TraceIdFilter and TraceIdInterceptor work together to ensure traceability of requests and logs across microservices. Here’s a detailed explanation of how they function:

1. TraceIdFilter

The TraceIdFilter ensures that every incoming HTTP request to a microservice has a traceId. If the request already includes a traceId (e.g., in the X-Trace-Id HTTP header), it uses that; otherwise, it generates a new one.

How It Works
	1.	Request Flow:
	•	When an HTTP request arrives at a microservice, the TraceIdFilter is invoked before the request is processed by the application (this is part of the servlet filter chain).
	2.	Extract or Generate TraceId:
	•	The filter checks for the presence of an X-Trace-Id header in the incoming request.
	•	If the header is present, the traceId is extracted.
	•	If the header is missing, the filter generates a new unique traceId using UUID.randomUUID().
	3.	Store in MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context):
	•	The traceId (and optionally a spanId) is stored in the MDC. MDC is a thread-local storage mechanism that allows adding contextual information to all log messages for that thread.
	•	This ensures that every log generated during the lifecycle of the request automatically includes the traceId and spanId.
	4.	Propagate to the Application:
	•	The traceId and spanId are available in the MDC for the entire lifecycle of the request.
	•	After the request is completed, the MDC is cleared to prevent data leaks between threads.

Code Walkthrough

public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
        throws IOException, javax.servlet.ServletException {
    HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;

    try {
        // Extract traceId from the incoming request header
        String traceId = httpRequest.getHeader("X-Trace-Id");
        
        // If no traceId is found, generate a new one
        if (traceId == null || traceId.isEmpty()) {
            traceId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        }

        // Add traceId and spanId to MDC
        MDC.put("traceId", traceId); // traceId is consistent across microservices
        MDC.put("spanId", UUID.randomUUID().toString()); // spanId is unique per microservice

        // Proceed with the request
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
    } finally {
        // Clear MDC to avoid leaking context between threads
        MDC.clear();
    }
}



2. TraceIdInterceptor

The TraceIdInterceptor ensures that when the current microservice makes an outgoing HTTP request (e.g., calling another microservice), the traceId from the MDC is propagated in the X-Trace-Id HTTP header.

How It Works
	1.	Request Flow:
	•	Before an outgoing HTTP request is sent, the TraceIdInterceptor is invoked.
	•	It intercepts the request using the RestTemplate or a similar HTTP client library.
	2.	Retrieve TraceId from MDC:
	•	The traceId that was previously stored in the MDC (by the TraceIdFilter) is retrieved.
	3.	Set TraceId in HTTP Header:
	•	The interceptor adds the traceId to the X-Trace-Id HTTP header of the outgoing request.
	4.	Downstream Microservice Receives TraceId:
	•	The downstream microservice (the recipient of the HTTP request) will receive the X-Trace-Id header and can use its own TraceIdFilter to extract and propagate the traceId further.

Code Walkthrough

public HttpRequest intercept(HttpRequest request, byte[] body, ClientHttpRequestExecution execution) throws IOException {
    // Retrieve traceId from MDC
    String traceId = MDC.get("traceId");
    
    if (traceId != null) {
        // Add traceId to the outgoing HTTP request header
        request.getHeaders().add("X-Trace-Id", traceId);
    }

    // Proceed with the HTTP request
    return execution.execute(request, body);
}

Workflow of Filter and Interceptor in Action

Here’s how the TraceIdFilter and TraceIdInterceptor work together in a distributed microservices system:

Step-by-Step Example
	1.	Incoming Request to Microservice A:
	•	A client (e.g., a frontend or another service) sends an HTTP request to Microservice A.
	•	The request might include an X-Trace-Id header.
	2.	TraceIdFilter in Microservice A:
	•	The TraceIdFilter checks for the X-Trace-Id header:
	•	If found, it adds the traceId to the MDC.
	•	If not found, it generates a new traceId and adds it to the MDC.
	•	All logs generated by Microservice A now include this traceId.
	3.	Outgoing Request from Microservice A to Microservice B:
	•	When Microservice A makes an HTTP call to Microservice B, the TraceIdInterceptor adds the traceId from the MDC to the X-Trace-Id header of the outgoing request.
	4.	Incoming Request to Microservice B:
	•	Microservice B receives the request with the X-Trace-Id header.
	•	The TraceIdFilter in Microservice B extracts the traceId from the header and adds it to the MDC.
	•	All logs in Microservice B now include the same traceId.
	5.	Propagation Continues Across Microservices:
	•	This process repeats for all downstream microservices. Each microservice ensures the same traceId is propagated and included in its logs.

Key Benefits of the Filter and Interceptor
	1.	Traceability Across Microservices:
	•	The same traceId links logs from multiple microservices, allowing end-to-end visibility for a single request in distributed systems.
	2.	Easy Debugging:
	•	Logs across services can be correlated in log aggregation tools (e.g., Splunk or ELK) using the traceId.
	3.	Consistency:
	•	The traceId remains consistent throughout the request lifecycle, while the spanId is unique per microservice, helping differentiate between different microservices in the chain.
	4.	Minimal Overhead:
	•	The MDC and headers add negligible overhead, ensuring the system remains performant.

Example Logs

Let’s assume a client sends a request to Microservice A, which calls Microservice B. Here’s how logs might look in each service:

Logs in Microservice A:

{
    "timestamp": "2024-12-12T10:00:00.000Z",
    "application": "microservice-a",
    "traceId": "abcd1234",
    "spanId": "a1b2c3",
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "Processing request"
}

Logs in Microservice B:

{
    "timestamp": "2024-12-12T10:00:02.000Z",
    "application": "microservice-b",
    "traceId": "abcd1234",
    "spanId": "d4e5f6",
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "Processing request from Microservice A"
}

Conclusion
	•	TraceIdFilter ensures every incoming request has a traceId and adds it to the MDC.
	•	TraceIdInterceptor ensures the traceId is passed to downstream microservices in the X-Trace-Id header.
	•	Together, these components enable distributed tracing with consistent traceId propagation across microservices. This makes debugging and monitoring in systems like Splunk or ELK seamless.
